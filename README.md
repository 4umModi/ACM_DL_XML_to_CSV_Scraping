# ACM_DL_XML_to_CSV_Scraping
python ./scraping.py

This script was made to parse through XML files from the ACM database.
The script was written by Alexander L. Hayes and Forum Modi (for reference)

The user menu in the terminal allows for user prompting
- Enter folder name
- Choose between proceedings/periodcials (can't do both at same time)
- Do you have nested folders (Forum's XML dump was nested, Zaidat's was not)
- How many journals/proceedings do you want to parse through? (0 for all)
- Enter output filename
